        <p><h3>
            1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
        </h3></p>
        <p>
            On the landing page there is a background image, an image of a logo and a welcome
            message to the user. The page redirects in 1.5 seconds to the about page. The about
            page has a very industry looking flavour photo, with some industry sounding language
            plus a contact email link, as well as the navigation bar and logo at its top left.
            <br><br>The logos text was chosen as "WEBSITELOGO" to reflect the
            placeholder text nature of the design. The navigation bar allows you to go to
            Unit 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, separated due to the large volume of text, while the navbar
            features a dropdown powered by javascript to traverse the three subsections of
            Unit 1. Unit 2 is represented by a single link. All of these pages contain similar
            elements, the same bottom left floating copyright text, navbar and centered text,
            with a "Return to Top" jump-link.
        </p>
        <p><h3>
            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        </h3></p>
        <p>
            A real site would display a copyright notice to assert intellectual property,
            to give warning that site assets and company logos for example, do not get stolen
            by other sites who might try to use it to gain credibility based on the brands
            reputation. In such cases the copyright notice gives the warning not to do so,
            so that the violation of copyright can be challenged in court.
            <br><br>
            GDPR is another legal aspect of websites, regulating consumer rights and privacy
            policy to ensure that the responsibilities of the site owner with regards to
            user data are strictly followed. Failure to do so can incur fines on the
            organisation and so best practise is to have someone qualified ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <p><h3>
            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
            people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
        </h3></p>
        <p>
            Accessiblity technology such as screen readers for the blind and partial sighted,
            require web developers to observe structural conventions such as 'alt text' for
            images. People with other disabilties, especially if considered to be a target
            audience for the site, could be catered for in the use of larger page elements,
            simpler page elements, the use of high contrast colour schemes and keeping the
            layout clean. 
        </p>
        <p><h3>
            1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
        </h3></p>
        <p>
            Appropriate filetypes for HTML5 are varied. The landing page should be named
            'index.html' and directory structure can be configured on the server otherwise.
            HTML documents should have the extension '.htm' or '.html'. External stylesheets
            should have the extension '.css'. External javascript files should have the
            extension '.js'. As for other file types for the web, audio and video files, 
            come in gif/jpg/png format primarily, audio and video can be ogg/mp3/mp4/avi
            and others exist for documents, such as doc/docx/pdf.
        </p>
        <p><h3>
            1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively
        </h3></p>
        <p>
            Once your website is complete, and all its files are ready to be put online,
            you might use an FTP client to upload, or just use the internet browser to
            upload to the server. The use of git allows files in your local project folders
            to be uploaded as they are created and edited, while git can also be used to
            download from the site, or from github to another machine who wants to develop
            the project.
