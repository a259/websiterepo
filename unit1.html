    <h1>Unit 1: Improving Productivity in IT</h1><hr>
    <h2>Outcome 1: Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3></p>
    <p> In business today, IT or Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is used
    to securely communicate, collaborate and streamline the work of staff in the
    pursuit of commerce with clients or customers
    <a href="https://www.oksbdc.org/why-is-technology-important-in-business/">[1]</a></p>
    <p><h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
    successfully, what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
    </h3></p>
    <p>A collaborative endeavour to accomplish a digital project hinges around good
    project management, leadership/communication skills and technology.
    <a href="https://www.workamajig.com/blog/digital-project-manager">[1]</a><br><br>
    
    Version Control Systems such as Git & Github, allow workers to share a codebase,
    divide labour into smaller units to work on separately, avoid collisions with other
    workers who might try and work on the same file, and track the iterations of the
    project. This allows code to be experimented on, rolled back to previous versions,
    or for new versions to be developed and tested, and when ready merged into a new
    and improved version ready for release.
    <a href="https://codeburst.io/git-and-github-in-a-nutshell-b0a3cc06458f">[2]</a><br><br>

    Kanban, or 'visual cards' software such as Trello can allow teams to collaboratively
    perform the role of a digital project manager, in a distributed way.
    Workers can plan and then adjust the plan as new tasks are identified and
    unforeseen tasks become apparent. Progress can be tracked and the speed of tasks
    progress be visible by all, helping to identify and defeat bottlenecks in the
    project before deadlines arrive.
    <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/project-management/kanban-board/">[3]</a><br><br>

    These tools facilitate communication across desks, departments and offices, 
    to enable even the smallest parts of an organisation in being seen and heard
    for their valuable contributions to overall strategy and workflow.</p>

    <p><h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you
    plan it? Include a link to your troll board.</h3></p>
    <p>The site will be planned with Trello, using my Board
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/lsQO5vK6/website">[1]</a>
    , i will have 3 Lists,
    that break up the project into 3 stages; 'To Do', 'Doing' and 'Done', and each
    will be populated with many Cards, initially to the left side of the Board and
    eventually being moved to the right side of the board as work is completed.

    </p>
    <p><h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
    projects to fail? Why?</h3></p>
    <p>
    Failure to adequately define and evaluate the projects scope, risks and
    key assumptions. Scope is the planning of the project, risks are obstructions
    to the project that may arise and key assumptions are e.g. potentially
    problematic expectations of things naturally going according to plan.<br><br>
    
    The projects scope should be structured in such detail that it identifies
    risky assumptions and bottlenecks in advance. The scope should also define
    a plan to evaluate the progress of the project. This will flag up emerging
    difficulties as they arise so effort can be refocused on them.<br><br>
    
    Failure to plan in detail, track progress and manage risk with formal
    methods and strategies, as well as managing expectations with the client
    and maintaining overall communication within the team and between it and
    the client are what can lead to serious problems with the project, its
    deadlines and its living up to client specification. 
    <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/15-causes-of-project-failure.php">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p><h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
    how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3></p>
    <p>Based upon the clients specfied requirements, i would research what popular tech
    stacks are often used for projects like these. Research would start with blogs to
    identify key technologies, then i would see those technologies testimonials and
    websites for examples of the technology in action, then browse forums and opinion
    for an overview of developer sentiment regarding its ease of use and performance.<br><br>
    
    Further review of the selected tech stack would check the solution serves the
    client needs in the following categories: Size, is the solution of low enough
    overheads for the project, Licensing, does the client have a budget or not for
    non-open source technology, Users, will the solution be simplistic enough to
    use for the target audience, and Growth, will the solution scale appropriately
    for the clients needs as the company/product grows.
    <a href="https://www.developeracademy.io/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-stack/">[1]</a><br><br>
    
    Finally review should ensure in-house compatibility with the skills and ability
    of the team, are they all senior developers or of a more mixed skill level?
    A prudent selection might depend on the tech stacks tried-and-true maturity,
    its ecosystem of online tutorials, experts, helpful forum community, while its
    outlook for long-term support affects how your team might maintain the project
    for the client in 5 or 10 years time all things going well.

    </p>
    <p><h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
    achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub
    help with your codes version control?</h3></p>
    <p>As someone who typically finds planning challenging to conceive of and structure,
    Trello has been invaluable in providing the framework to do so in an at-a-glance
    and easy to re-organise way, so thoughts can become tangible nodes of organisation
    in seconds.<br><br>
    Meanwhile github has helped keep my local files backed up, secure
    and free from risk of erasure. Meanwhile as daily additions and revisions made
    their way into the codebase, the ability to see what was improved and when gives
    a helpful reminder as to the thoughts processes and directions of the project.
    </p>
    <p><h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects –
    How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3></p>
    <p>Developers in choosing a tech stack might consider the legal limitations of its
    licenses before selecting it. Some technologies have licenses which prohibit their
    use if the product its used to build will be modified, proprietary or for profit.<br><br>
    
    In the development of customer facing products that store personal data, theres
    the Data Protection Act (DPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to
    legislate how privacy and data retention policy must be developed and adhered to.<br><br>
    
    It means the user must be given more choices on how their data is managed, or
    access on request to their data, or request its deletion. Non-compliance with
    these consumer rights, or failure to protect personal data can incur large fines
    for organisations. This effects design choices such as user registration forms, 
    database security steps, reducing personally identifiable details to a minimum,
    all as part of a methodology of data protection by design and default.<br><br>
    
    It also means having contingency plans in the event of a data breach to inform
    customers and the Information Commissioners Office. GDPR compliant design is an
    important part of any digital project and either an employee who is competent
    in GDPR or a legal expert should be employed to verify compliance.
