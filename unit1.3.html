    <h1>Unit 1: Improving Productivity in IT</h1><hr>
    <h2>Outcome 3: Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems</h2>
    <hr>

    <p><h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in
        terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient
        when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3></p>
    <p>The drawbacks of the IT tools and systems previously identified in this
        assignment so far, might include an excessive overlay of complexity, adding
        more steps to a simple problem and more programs and websites than needed.
        That said, as projects become bigger and the problems become more complex,
        all of these tools come into their own, preserving multiple versions and
        progress, aiding complex tasks in being broken down into manageable pieces
        and their progress tracked. In either case VSCode is a very useful tool,
        bringing text editing into one place and making it easier to traverse
        multiple files in the project.
        <br><br>
        I could have been more efficient if i had started with the simplest elements
        first, then built more using just lorem ipsum and the simplest possible
        structuring and styling. To reach a satisfactory state i had to abandon and
        remove stylistic choices that had become overcomplicated, wasting lots of
        time. I cannot see how teams would improve such a simple website.
    </p>

    <p><h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3></p>
    <p>Ways to improve both efficiency and productivity might generally include
        keeping design simple, implementing design without any tangents into any
        extra complexity than is strictly necessary, while reusing code across
        html pages and stylesheets to reduce the surface area of debugging and
        typing. Code commenting everything you add as you go also helps reduce
        the need to go back and unravel buggy code.
    </p>

    <p><h3>
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects –
        what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
    </h3></p>
    <p>I would consider improving digital project productivity, by learning to use some
        javascript driven framework that uses off the shelf templates for laying out sites
        like these and just filling in the elements text by hand, then tweaking settings
        to just customise style and not worry about structure. I would continue to use
        a good text editor/IDE like VSCode, back up my works progress with Github and
        use trello to go into greater detail planning more complex sites. In the case of
        sites being larger and more complex, team contributions to broken down sections
        could greatly improve the speed of the project by using trello to co-ordinate a
        projects completion as quickly as possible using scrum methodology.
    </p>

    <p><h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3></p>
    <p>I would break up the website into chunks and assign them to team members on trello.
        Each chunks functionality would be tested by each team member, to make sure no
        links were broken, that buttons did what they should and that any forms submitted
        and stored data appropriately. I would assign one team member to assess its
        conformance to GDPR, and another team member to check every page displays
        correctly on multiple viewports and that the structure and styling is consistent.
