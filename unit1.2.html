    <h1>Unit 1: Improving Productivity in IT</h1><hr>
    <h2>Outcome 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful</h2>
    <hr>

    <p><h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in
        making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3></p>
    <p> First i set up the github and trello and then got on with the first unit of
        coursework, which i authored in plain text in VSCode, and then placed that
        text into a html document. This has informed the choice of html element tags
        to use and subsequently the stylesheets selectors and their properties.
        After tidying up the look a bit i pushed the code to the github repo again
        and it looks good on github Pages. I updated trello to reflect progress.
    </p>

    <p><h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello        
    </h3></p>
    <p>For planning the project trello is a good tool due to its simple interface and
        inspiring user interface, quickly you understand how to break up your project
        into manageable chunks.
        For writing the content for the coursework, VSCode works well due to its
        intellisense system that predicts code completion, does syntax highlighting
        and integrates the terminal for easy github synchronisation.
        For keeping the code backed up and up to date, giving me optional rollback,
        plus hosting the site on github Pages, github has given peace of mind while
        writing code and has been easy to use.
    </p>    

    <p><h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy
        with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in
        the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3></p>
    <p>Im reasonably happy with the appearance of the website, it looks clean, evenly
        partitioned and symmetrical. It has a navbar area integrating a logo, a footer
        communicating copyright and a centered text area. There is a background image
        that utilises transparency, as do all the elements of the page have variable
        opacity, giving everything an evenness to improve readability. There is also
        a landing page to demonstrate the use of the img tag. If i have time, what i
        would change is redoing the CSS from scratch to review all its functionality.
    </p>

    <p><h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3></p>
    <p>I could add some javascript functionality to the page(s), perhaps the landing
        page, but the elements the brief has called for can be achieved with HTML and
        CSS only. Perhaps the image and logo can be faded in, thats an improvement.
        If the word count of this assignment grows much more, i might join the pages 
        for Unit1&2 in a single page, that uses a sidebar to navigate between outcomes,
        this sidebar would be an appropriate use of javascript.
    </p>

    <p><h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3></p>
    <p>
        The requirements are; an index.html page, this could be the about page, or an
        about page can be separate but must be functionally present. There must be
        multiple coursework pages, there must be an image used in a page, a use of
        subheadings, div sections, references, while all the pages must be contained
        in one root folder. All of these conditions have been met, they are present
        and fully functional and are styled to a decent standard.
